Hello! I am **Zonglin Yang**, a first-year Ph.D. student at Nanyang Technological University supervised by [Erik Cambria](https://sentic.net/erikcambria/). Before NTU, I obtained my master's degree at Cornell University, supervised by [Claire Cardie](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie/) and [Xinya Du](https://xinyadu.github.io/), and my bachelor's degree at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, supervised by [Xinggang Wang](https://xwcv.github.io/). Previously, I interned at Microsoft Research Asia mentored by [Li Dong](http://dong.li/).


Research
======
My current research center around Knowledge & Reasoning in Natural Language Processing.

Some of my past representative research are:

(1) Bridging research between classic AI (Knowledge Representation and Reasoning) and Natural Language Processing, e.g., [Inductive Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10923.pdf) and [Case-based Reasoning](http://sentic.net/commonsense-knowledge-base-completion.pdf).

(2) Analyze and augment existing pretrained (large) language model's ability on specified and fundamental types of reasoning, e.g., [Inductive Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10923.pdf).

(3) A [Survey on Logical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12023.pdf) over Natural Language as Knowledge Representation.  
<!-- It surveys papers under a new paradigm of logical reasoning that uses natural language as knowledge representation and PLMs as reasoners. In contrast, in the classic AI research of logical reasoning, formal language is used as knowledge representation, and symbolic methods are used as reasoners.   -->

(4) Improving [Temporal Commonsense Reasoning](https://aclanthology.org/2020.findings-emnlp.302/) via distant supervision.



<!-- My primary research goal is to apply Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing and develop **Language Technology for All**. To achievethis goal and make language technology accessible in most people’s lives, I identify two major research topics that I’m interested in: **efficiency** and **trustworthiness** of NLP models. Efficiency involves both the amount of **computation** and **data** required for (pre-)training and using NLP models. Trustworthiness involves the **interpretability**, **fairness**, and **robustness** with respect to adversarial attacks and out-of-distribution samples.  

Specifically I am interested in the following research topics:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Natural language generation, creative text generation, evaluation for NLG models.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Commonsense reasoning and knowledge-based reasoning.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Robust NLP models for OOD samples and reducing spurious dataset biases.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Interpretability, explainability, biases, and fairness for NLP models.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Green NLP, Low resource NLP, and Learning NLP models from high-level supervision**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Multi-modality**   -->
