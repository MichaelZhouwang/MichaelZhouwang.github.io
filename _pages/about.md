Hello! I am **Wangchunshu Zhou**, cofounder&CTO of [AIWaves Inc.](https://www.aiwaves.org/) I was a Ph.D. student in the Institute of Machine Learning at ETH Zürich advised by [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/) and [Mrinmaya Sachan](http://www.mrinmaya.io/). I obtained my undergraduate and master’s degree at Beihang University, supervised by [Ke Xu](http://sites.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/~kexu/). I spent one year as a Predoctoral Young Investigator at AI2, Mosaic Team, working with [Ronan Le Bras](https://allenai.org/team/ronanl) and [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/). Previously, I interned at Microsoft Research Asia with [Tao Ge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tage/), and at Bytedance AI Lab with [Jingjing Xu](https://jingjingxu.com/) and [Hang Li](http://www.hangli-hl.com/), and also spent some time working with [Xiang Ren](https://shanzhenren.github.io/) at USC and with [Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/) at MILA. Please check my [CV](/files/CV-chunshu.pdf) for further information.

I am actively looking for research collaborations! For master/undergrad students looking for research experience or PhD students looking for collaborations, please send me an email at <wangchunshu.zhou@inf.ethz.ch>.


Research
======
My research interest lies in AGI. My current research goal is to bridge the gap between powerful pre-trained large language models (LLMs) such as GPTs and their impact on the lives of humankind, and develop **Language Technology for All**.  

To achieve this goal and make LLMs more accessible in most people’s lives, I identify two major research topics that I’m interested in: **creative generation** with LLMs (AIGC) and **alignment** of LLMs. Creative text generation with LLMs involves methods to better **control** and **customize** LLMs, and enable **interactive** or **collaborative** text generation. Alignment means aligning LLMs with human values, which includes the **interpretability**, **fairness**, and **safety** of LLMs and their applications.

Specifically I am interested in the following research topics:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Efficient NLP with LLMs and Learning NLP models from high-level supervision**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Natural language generation, creative text generation, evaluation for NLG models.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Multi-modality**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Commonsense reasoning and knowledge-based reasoning.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Interpretability, explainability, biases, and fairness for NLP models.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Robust NLP models for OOD samples and reducing spurious dataset biases.**
