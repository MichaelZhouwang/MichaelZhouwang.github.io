Hello! I am **Wangchunshu Zhou**. I'm currently leading the Personal AI Team at OPPO AI Center. Before that, I was the cofounder&CTO of [AIWaves Inc.](https://www.aiwaves.org/) I was a Ph.D. student in the Institute of Machine Learning at ETH Zürich advised by [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/) and [Mrinmaya Sachan](http://www.mrinmaya.io/). I obtained my undergraduate and master’s degree at Beihang University, supervised by [Ke Xu](http://sites.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/~kexu/). I spent one year as a Predoctoral Young Investigator at AI2, Mosaic Team, working with [Ronan Le Bras](https://allenai.org/team/ronanl) and [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/). Previously, I interned at Microsoft Research Asia with [Tao Ge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tage/), and at Bytedance AI Lab with [Jingjing Xu](https://jingjingxu.com/) and [Hang Li](http://www.hangli-hl.com/). I also spent some time working with [Xiang Ren](https://shanzhenren.github.io/) at USC and with [Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/) at MILA. Please check my [CV](/files/chunshu_cv_2410.pdf) for further information.

I am actively looking for interns/FTEs at OPPO AI Center. If you are interested in working with us on AI Personalization, LLMs, Agents, Superintelligence & Superalignment, feel free to email me at <zhouwangchunshu@oppo.com> (do not forget to attach your CV).

I am also looking for research collaborations! If you share similar research interests with me and are looking for collaborations, feel free to email me at <zhouwangchunshu@oppo.com>.


Research
======
My research interest lies in AGI. My current research goal is to bridge the gap between powerful pre-trained large language models and their impact on the lives of humankind, and develop **Language Technology for All**.

To achieve this goal, I identify two major research topics that I’m currently interested in: **content generation** with LLMs and building LLMs and **LLM systems (agents)** to achieve AGI.

Content generation with LLMs involves methods to better **control** and **customize** LLMs to generate desirable texts of **arbitrary length** that are **personalized**, **creative**, and **useful**. I am also interested in improving human-AI interaction in AI-assisted writing and building a next-generation human-AI **collaborative** writing platform.

Content generation with LLMs involves methods to better **control** and **customize** LLMs to generate desirable texts of **arbitrary length** that are **personalized**, **creative**, and **useful**. I am also interested in improving human-AI interaction in smart writing and build next-generation human-AI **collaborative** writing platform, which is more efficient and deliver smoother experience compared to previous AI-assisted writing systems.

As for AGI research, I am passionate about building algorithms that enable:

- Data-centric AI Agents that can learn from experience and self-evolve after being created and deployed in the wild.
- LLMs that can self-improve without external human supervision.

I am also interested in or working in the following subjects:

- Efficient methods for LLMs and Low resource NLP.
- Generative AI: text generation and its evaluation.
- Language model pre-training and transfer learning for NLP.
- Commonsense reasoning and knowledge-based reasoning.
- Multi-modality, text-to-image generation.
