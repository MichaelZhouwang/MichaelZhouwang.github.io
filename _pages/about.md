Hello! I am **Wangchunshu Zhou**, a first-year Ph.D. student in the Institute of Machine Learning at ETH Zürich, where he is supervised by [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/) and [Mrinmaya Sachan](http://www.mrinmaya.io/). I obtained my undergraduate and master’s degree at Beihang University, supervised by [Ke Xu](http://sites.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/~kexu/). He spent one year as a Predoctoral Young Investigator at AI2, Mosaic Team, working with [Ronan Le Bras](https://allenai.org/team/ronanl) and [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/). Previously, I interned at Microsoft Research Asia with [Tao Ge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tage/) and at Bytedance AI Lab with [Jingjing Xu](https://jingjingxu.com/) and [Hang Li](http://www.hangli-hl.com/), and also spent some time working with [Xiang Ren](https://shanzhenren.github.io/) at USC and with [Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/) at MILA. Please check my [CV](/files/CV-chunshu.pdf) for further information.


Research
======
My primary research goal is to apply Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing and develop **Language Technology for All**. To achievethis goal and make language technology accessible in most people’s lives, I identify two major research topics that I’m interested in: **efficiency** and **trustworthiness** of NLP models. Efficiency involves both the amount of **computation** and **data** required for (pre-)training and using NLP models. Trustworthiness involves the **interpretability**, **fairness**, and **robustness** with respect to adversarial attacks and out-of-distribution samples.  

Specifically I am interested in the following research topics:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Natural language generation, creative text generation, evaluation for NLG models.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Commonsense reasoning and knowledge-based reasoning.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Robust NLP models for OOD samples and reducing spurious dataset biases.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Interpretability, explainability, biases, and fairness for NLP models.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Green NLP, Low resource NLP, and Learning NLP models from high-level supervision**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Multi-modality**  
I am open to academic collaborations and please drop me an email if you are interested in collaborating with me.
