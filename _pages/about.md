Hello! I am **Wangchunshu Zhou**. I'm currently the director of the Personal AI Lab at OPPO. Before that, I was the cofounder&CTO of [AIWaves Inc.](https://www.aiwaves.org/) I was a Ph.D. student in the Institute of Machine Learning at ETH Zürich advised by [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/) and [Mrinmaya Sachan](http://www.mrinmaya.io/). I obtained my undergraduate and master’s degree at Beihang University, supervised by [Ke Xu](http://sites.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/~kexu/). I spent one year as a Predoctoral Young Investigator at AI2, Mosaic Team, working with [Ronan Le Bras](https://allenai.org/team/ronanl) and [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/). Previously, I interned at Microsoft Research Asia with [Tao Ge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tage/) and Furu Wei, and at Bytedance AI Lab with [Jingjing Xu](https://jingjingxu.com/) and [Hang Li](http://www.hangli-hl.com/). I also spent some time working with [Xiang Ren](https://shanzhenren.github.io/) at USC and with [Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/) at MILA. Please check my [CV](/files/chunshu_cv_2410.pdf) for further information.

I am actively hiring Research Scientists, LLM Engineers, and Research Interns at OPPO Personal AI Lab. If you are interested in working with us on AI Personalization, LLMs, Agents, Superintelligence & Superalignment, feel free to email me at <zhouwangchunshu@oppo.com> (do not forget to attach your CV).

I am also looking for research collaborations! If you share similar research interests with me and are looking for research collaborations, feel free to email me at <zhouwangchunshu@oppo.com>.


Research
======
My research interest lies in AGI. In particular, my current research goal is to:

- Build **Personalized** AI systems that can better understand and adapt to the diverse and ever-changing characteristics and preferences of every user. 
- Build **AI Agents** and **LLMs** that are super capable, helpful for real-world products, and can continuously **self-improve** to achieve "superintelligence".
- Build interactive AI/Agentic systems that redefine conventional workflows for **content creation/consumption** and fully unleash the potential of GenAI for expanding the limit of creativity of mankind. 

I am also interested in or actively working on the following topics:

- Efficient methods for LLMs and Agents.
- Text Generation and its evaluation.
- Language model pre-training and transfer learning for NLP.
- Commonsense reasoning.
- Multi-modality, text-to-image/video generation, Any-to-Any LLMs.
